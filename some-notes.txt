ngModel directive used to assess value entered into form using {{ from.value | json}}

-> form is declared at the top inside form tag as #form="ngForm"
-> 2 way data binding [(1)]='2'
	
	1 -> ngModel
	2 -> references what ever has been added to the parent component in this case it 	is the data model

---------------
Copying form data
... = spread operator will copy what is in our the original data user setting and create a copy inside the user settings 

to make a deper copy use load hash which has a method deepClone.

 ---> Aim of having two sets of data is that if user went back or dind send the form we would lose data or corrupt instead 
 		we can add logic so that once form is sent we can themn copy user data to original data
