ngModel directive used to assess value entered into form using {{ from.value | json}}

-> form is declared at the top inside form tag as #form="ngForm"
-> 2 way data binding [(1)]='2'
	
	1 -> ngModel
	2 -> references what ever has been added to the parent component in this case it 	is the data model

---------------
Copying form data
... = spread operator will copy what is in our the original data user setting and create a copy inside the user settings

ngNativeValidate turns off web form validation because all web browsers validate and display different messages this

	-> add ngNativeValidate where ="ngForm" is to allow web validation

	-> ng-touched = hovering, clicking etc, on an specific section
	-> ng-pristine = wild is empty
